C and MATLAB code projects

bestfitLA1.c
>>> Assignment 1: C
>>> Calculates a best fit line equation by excluding outliers.
>>> Chooses between files (server files from Dartmouth) datafile1.txt, datafile2.txt..... datafile6.txt.
>>> Data files contain x and y coordinates in two columns.
>>> Enters a value to determine outlier range (ex.: 2.5)
>>> Program returns equation in slope-intercept form.

moviesLA2.c
>>> Assignment 2: C
>>> Creates interactive inventory for storing data about movies.
>>> Displays information about title, genre, rating, year of release, customer rating, and number of times rented.
>>> Choose between loading data from a file, displaying current inventory, sorting inventory, searching inventory, deleting/adding a movie, and saving inventory to file.

LA3.m
>>> Assignment 3: MATLAB
>>> Calculates the trajectory of a ball thrown into a basket both directly and bouncing off the wall, given certain variables.
>>> Loads variables (goal position, wind, speed, distance to wall, etc.) from local file inputs.txt.
>>> Uses bisection to calculate angle of both throws.
>>> Displays 2 figures for each throw, showing bisection and final result.
>>> Calculates maximum height for direct throw and location on wall for bounce throw.
